# FDTD_Wakefields
Repository for code used when simulating electromagnetic phenomena with moving electron density distribution (Plasma wakes).
The wakefield model is the full one and the code is hopefully well commented to help the understanding of units and how it works. Probably some function definitions come in bad order regarding readability but I've done my best as to arrange them in good fashion!
